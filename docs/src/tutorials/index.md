# Tutorials

## Executing the Tutorial Notebooks

The tutorials are set up to run using GitHub Codespaces. To run the tutorials, click on 
the "Open in Codespaces" button from the GitHub repository. This will open a 
pre-configured environment with a VSCode IDE in your browser. THe environment contains 
all the necessary dependencies and sample data to run the tutorials.

## Installation

Installation of the Element requires an integrated development environment and database.
Instructions to setup each of the components can be found on the
[User Instructions](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/user-guide/) page. The example
tutorial uses several Elements (Lab, Animal, Session, Event, and Electrophysiology) to construct
a complete pipeline, and is able to ingest experimental metadata and run model training
and inference.

### Videos

The [Element Array Ephys tutorial](https://youtu.be/KQlGYOBq7ow?t=3658) gives an
overview of the workflow files and notebooks as well as core concepts related to
Electrophysiology.

### Notebooks

Each of the notebooks in the workflow
([download here](https://github.com/datajoint/workflow-array-ephys/tree/main/notebooks))
steps through ways to interact with the Element itself. For convenience, these notebooks
are also rendered as part of this site. To try out the Elements notebooks in an online
Jupyter environment with access to example data, visit
[CodeBook](https://codebook.datajoint.io/). (Electrophysiology notebooks coming soon!)
